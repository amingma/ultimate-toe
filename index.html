        <h1>Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Board Structure
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game is played on a 3x3 grid of tic-tac-toe boards, making a total of 9 smaller boards</li>
                    <li>Each smaller board contains 9 cells, similar to a traditional tic-tac-toe board</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Objective
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The goal is to win three of the smaller boards in a row, column, or diagonal, which wins you the overall game</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Gameplay
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first player can place their mark on any square on any of the smaller tic-tac-toe boards</li>
                    <li>After the first move, the cell chosen by the first player determines which smaller board the next player must play in</li>
                    <li>For example, if Player 1 places their mark in the top-right cell of any smaller board, Player 2 must place their mark in the top-right smaller board</li>
                    <li>If the designated smaller board is already won or full, the next player can play in any remaining open cell on any smaller board</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Winning
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game ends in a player's victory when they have won three smaller boards in a row, column, or diagonal</li>
                    <li>If all smaller boards are full without possible moves left, then the game ends in a draw</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
